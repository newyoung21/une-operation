## How to redeem point for cash and other rewards?

When a listing is deemed valid, the owner will be rewarded points accordingly. You can go to the event page from home page, and participate in the unlocking cash reward event. Every 100 points can be redeemed for one unlock that contributes varied portion to the accumulation of the total 100 u big reward. When you successfully unlock total 100 u, a cash out option will be available and cash reward will be transferred to the connected wallet address. Any unredeemed points can be saved for future reward events.

Attention here! Not only your own listing will be rewarded points! We want to extend this to any friends you invite to our platform who also validly list NFTs! The more NFT you list, the more friends you invite, the more points you earn!

## _Let’s use an example to show the math:_

John joins the listing event on UneMeta. John owns 5 NFTs, there are 1 “SS”, 2 “S”, 2 ”N”, and all 5 are validly listed on UneMeta. At the same time he invites Joe and Jane to participate in the listing event as well. 

Hence, John receives total points 200+100+100+50+50+100+100 = 700
700 points can be redeemed for 7 cash unlocks. 

Sneak peak on what’s to come: any friends invited by John will be tagged as and only as John’s connections. Any future transactions by these connections of John’s on UneMeta will grant John additional benefits in the future! Stay tuned!

Each NFT of one wallet is only eligible for claiming UUU rewards once. Double listing will not create extra UUU reward.
